    "## Understanding Word2Vec\n",
    "Word2Vec trains embeddings by using them as input to a logistic regression model, trained to predict a word given nearby words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can think of Word2Vec as a neural network with linear activations and one hidden layer, trained to predict a word given nearby words.\n",
    "In this interpretation, the input and output of the model are both one-hot encoded vectors, and the embeddings of the words are the activations of the hidden layer given that word's one-hot encoding as input.\n",
    "Since the inputs are one-hot encoded, it's more efficient (but equivalent) to use an embedding lookup instead of a matrix multiply for the first layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is produced by taking any large body of text (e.g. Wikipedia) and creating (context, target) pairs, where the target is any word and the context is the $n$ words to its left and right.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common ways of training Word2Vec:\n",
    " - The \"skip-gram\" model uses the target word as input and predicts context words.\n",
    " - The \"continuous bag-of-words\" (CBOW) model uses the context words as input and predicts the target word\n",
    " \n",
    "We'll focus on the CBOW model, since it tends to work better for small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of generating the data for CBOW is as follows:\n",
    " 1. Tokenize (convert words, which are strings, to integer \"tokens\" indicating the word) the dataset by assigning each word a unique integer (integer encoding)\n",
    " 2. For each word in the dataset, create a single (`context`, `target`) pair, where `target` is the integer encoding of the word and `context` is a list of the integer encodings of the $n=1$ words to the left and right of the target word\n",
    "\n",
    "(I've already written the code to do this for you below)\n",
    " \n",
    "Then, the model is trained to predict the one-hot encoding of the target word given the integer encodings of the context words:\n",
    " 1. For each context word, look up its embedding in a table\n",
    " 2. Combine these into an \"average context embedding,\" which is the depth-wise average of the embeddings of the individual context words. This results in a single embedding vector, which acts as the \"total context\" in some sense.\n",
    " 3. Perform a logistic regression (equivalently, a single dense layer with softmax activation) to predict the target word using the average context embedding as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of full logistic regression, which uses the softmax function over all of the many words that appear in the dataset, we will use candidate sampling (specifically, noise-contrastive estimation) to compute the loss.\n",
    "This should speed up training significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on Word2Vec, see [TensorFlow's \"Vector Representations of Words\" tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/representation/word2vec), or Alex Minnaar's two tutorials, [one on the skip-gram model](http://alexminnaar.com/2015/04/12/word2vec-tutorial-skipgram.html) and [the other on the CBOW model](http://alexminnaar.com/2015/05/18/word2vec-tutorial-continuousbow.html)."
