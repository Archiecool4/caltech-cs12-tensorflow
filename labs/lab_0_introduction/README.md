# Lab 0: Introduction
This is essientally just setup and a quick check of python experience. If you struggle on this assignment you may want to reconsider taking the class. If you are curious about what level of code you will be required to write, you can always take a look at the notes or future labs.

We also take a look at the documentation for TensorFlow because it will be a **very** important resource in this class.

There arn't any notes this week, but following weeks will have notes along with the assignments that you should read in full before starting.

Concepts this week:
 - git
 - Coding style
 - Python list comprehensions
 - Python classes

TensorFlow features this week:
 - Just taking a look at the documentation

Optional material:
